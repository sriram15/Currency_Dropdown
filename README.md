flutter package for Currency Dropdown. 

## Getting Started

- Add the package in pubspec.yaml `currency_dropdown: ^0.0.2`

    * currencies.json should be within data folder in the root directory
    
 The list of currencies is from json list added to the package thanks to mhs/world-currencies(https://github.com/mhs/world-currencies)

## Note:

There might be an issue in ios where it says "The edge of the RenderFlex that is overflowing has been marked in the rendering with a yellow and
    black striped pattern". Have a look at the below issue in flutter where there is a fix mentioned as well.
